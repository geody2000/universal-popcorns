<div class="question_asked">It was a sombre morn, a fortnight before my arrival at the education facility. I was thrilled to aquire the skill of the everpresent art of music making, moreso master it. It was the final frontier that my search had led me after all these decades. Yet, a roaring suspicion emerged when I recognised the handwriting from the letter they had delivered the morrow of the yester day. As I delved into my investigation of searching for the author; which I soon found to be the school's administrator as well, my aged heart sank. A foreboding shiver rose up my spine as I quickly realised that the headmaster of the facility was none other than... an old friend.</div>
<br>
<div class="question_answer">I'm trying to find the meaning of this literary outpouring of emotions. I'd like to think <i>I</i> was the teacher, and that the years had turned me into an old sage with thick orange beard living in a mountain village and handing down my knowledge to the young ones, knowledge that had long been forgotten, or destroyed.</div>

	<div class="question_asked">yo man i was checking out ur music earlier and i found a chord that really just stuck with me i dont know how u did it but i think you may have just invented a new chord so check this out there is a moment in ur simfonietta for the broken oboe, specifically at the 32:53 mark, where you play a chord that has the notes C E G</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">Yeah, that's a basic C major triad.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">im really trying to figure out what u did there and at first i was like, that must be a rootless Am7.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">Nah, it's just a C major.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">but then im like no, this has to be a Bb13#11(no5)/C</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">That's what I was thinking at first, but then I changed my mind.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">this chord is now an extension of me</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">Funnily enough, my original triad has no extensions.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">its just so complex and intricate, sharply dissonant with extra spice</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">I'm glad it's making you feel this way, I thought I should have included a polychord there.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">it feels like it is deeply rooted in the cosmos, it has life and beauty but i can also hear the tragedy and fragility of existence</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">Yeah you may wanna check with your otolaryngologist there, and possibly psychiatrist.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">imagination, brilliance, poetry, the beauty of Art and Life synopsized into one tiny moment captured in the vastness and coldness of space and time</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">Space is pretty big.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">i hear the oboi playing your GaltDm7b5addnat10add#12#15/Bb&#119082;augminmaj7</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">Whoah, you're just making stuff up now.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">and im filled with a sense of urgency and inadequacy but also relief and safety.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">Ah yes, that's what I meant when I wrote it.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">i can feel the strong socio-political statement emerging from those three notes</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">I try to be vocal about stuff, like when I write vocal music.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">and the phrasing, wow, so intentional and heartwarming, tragically comical, but also dramatic and introspective</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">I think it's just a sustained triad played through General MIDI.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">you can feel the spring of a lost time, flowing through the sweet timbré of this silky textural conglomeration</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">What the heck are you talking abou- I mean yeah, it was all carefully crafted.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">there is complexity in the simplicity, and some say its a simple c major triad</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">YES!!! YES!! BECAUSE IT IS!!!</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">but those are just haters and naysayers</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">I can see that.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">but what makes your brilliant art piece even better is the chord that follows immediately after</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">(Isn't the next chord also C major?)</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">a chord with the notes B#, G triple flat and Bb double flat duodecuple sharp</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">Are you sure you are following standard enharmonic spelling procedures?</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">where do i even start</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">How about Tom Gerou's and Linda Lusk's Essential Dictionary of Musical Notation?</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">this chord sucks</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">Ouch.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">BUT</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">Oh no.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">coupled with the first chord, contextually speaking, forms a cadence unprecedented in musical history</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_answer">I think I might be retiring from show business.</div>
	<br>
	<div class="question_asked">this super-ultra-hyper-mega-meta-lydian-aeolian-exotic-bird-superlocrian-hypophrygian-double-harmonic-major-subdominant-plagal-suspension-chain-tritone-substitution-rhythmic-displacement-negative-macroharmony cadence sends a message</div>
